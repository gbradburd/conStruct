\title{Run a conStruct cross-validation analysis}
\usage{
x.validation(train.prop = 0.9, n.reps, K, freqs, geoDist, coords, prefix,
  n.iter, make.figs = FALSE, save.files = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{train.prop}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 that gives 
the proportions of the data to be used in the 
training partition of the analysis. Default is 0.9.}

\item{n.reps}{An \code{integer} giving the number of cross-
validation replicates to be run.}

\item{K}{A numeric \code{vector} giving the numbers of layers 
to be tested in each cross-validation replicate.
E.g., \code{K=1:7}.}

\item{freqs}{A \code{matrix} of allele frequencies with one column per 
locus and one row per sample.
    Missing data should be indicated with \code{NA}.}

\item{geoDist}{A \code{matrix} of geographic distance between samples. 
If \code{NULL}, user can only run the nonspatial model.}

\item{coords}{A \code{matrix} giving the longitude and latitude 
(or X and Y coordinates) of the samples.}

\item{prefix}{A character \code{vector} giving the prefix to be attached 
to all output files.}

\item{n.iter}{An \code{integer} giving the number of iterations each MCMC 
chain is run. Default is 1e3.  If the number of iterations 
is greater than 500, the MCMC is thinned so that the number 
of retained iterations is 500 (before burn-in).}

\item{make.figs}{A \code{logical} value indicating whether to automatically 
make figures during the course of the cross-validation analysis. 
Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{save.files}{A \code{logical} value indicating whether to automatically 
save output and intermediate files once the analysis is
complete. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
This function returns a \code{list} containing the 
	standardized results of the cross-validation analysis
	across replicates.  For each replicate, the function returns 
		a list with the following elements:
	\itemize{
		\item \code{sp} - the mean of the standardized log likelihoods of the 
	"testing" data partition of that replicate for the spatial model for
		each value of K specified in \code{K}.
		\item \code{nsp} - the mean of the standardized log likelihoods of the 
	"testing" data partitions of that replicate for the nonspatial model for
		each value of K specified in \code{K}.
}

\description{
\code{x.validation} runs a conStruct cross-validation analysis
}
\details{
This function initiates a cross-validation analysis that 
uses Monte Carlo cross-validation to determine the statistical 
support for models with different numbers of layers or 
with and without a spatial component.
