Description: A method for modeling genetic data as a combination of discrete
    clusters, within each of which relatedness may decay continuously with
    geographic distance. This package contains code for running analyses (which are
    implemented in the modeling language rstan) and visualizing and interpreting
    output. See the paper for more details on the model and its utility.
