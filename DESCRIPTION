Title: Models Spatially Continuous and Discrete Population Genetic Structure
Description: A method for modeling genetic data as a combination of discrete
    layers, within each of which relatedness may decay continuously with geographic
    distance. This package contains code for running analyses (which are implemented
    in the modeling language 'rstan') and visualizing and interpreting output. See the
    paper for more details on the model and its utility.
