conStruct (continuous Structure) ReadMe
========================================

This repo contains the code for the method conStruct - a statistical tool 
for modeling continuous and discrete population genetic structure.

The manuscript, data files, and analysis scripts associated with the publication 
"Inferring Continuous and Discrete Population Genetic Structure Across Space,"
(https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.118.301333) have been moved, and can now be found at 
github.com/gbradburd/conStruct-paper.

Installation
========================================
To install the R package:

	> library(devtools)
	
	> install_github("gbradburd/conStruct",build_vignettes=TRUE)

========================================
Getting Started
========================================
There is a vignette walking through the data format used in conStruct analyses, 
which you can walk through using the command:

	> vignette(topic="format-data",package="conStruct")

A second vignette, which walks through how to run a conStruct analysis, can 
be viewed using the command:

	> vignette(topic="run-conStruct",package="conStruct")

A third vignette, which walks through how to compare and select between 
different conStruct models, can be viewed using the command:

	> vignette(topic="model-comparison",package="conStruct")


There is also an example data file included in the package, which you can 
load using the command:

	> data(conStruct.data)
